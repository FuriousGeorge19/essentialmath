Welcome to *Essential Math for Data Science*!

You'll find here the notebooks with all the code corresponding to each chapter of the book.

# Run the Code

I think that you might gain a lot of insights by running the code as you read the book to be sure that you follow along. It permits you to check the shapes of the arrays we'll manipulate, looking at the variables to see what's inside, run interactive plots with `%matplotlib notebook`, and so on.

Some notebooks use external datasets that I gathered [here](https://github.com/hadrienj/essential_math_for_data_science). However, to run the hands-on project about PCA (Chapter 09), you'll need to download the database (as explained in the text).

Each notebook starts with a cell containing the imports, then you'll see a cell containing latex commands (appearing as an empty markdown cell). You'll also need to run it to have the commands available.

# Sections

You'll see cross-references in the text, like for instance: "Section 2.3". The first number tells you the Chapter number so you can find the right notebook and go look in it for more details.

# Ask Questions as Issues

The goal of this repository is also to allow you to ask question about anything you have trouble to understand in the book.

For each of these questions, fill an issue with a meaningful title and I'll try my best to help you and guide you to remove your blocker.

You can also participate in discussion and answer other people's answer

# Feedback

You can also give me your feedback, comments, erratas, and all things that you think could improve the book. You can also use issues for this purpose.
